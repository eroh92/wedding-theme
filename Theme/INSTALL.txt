This document covers the installation procedures to get you started with Hand Crafted. 
  
  ----------------------
  * Installing the theme
  ----------------------

  You can install the theme in 2 ways: By using the ZIP file provided and uploading via your 
  WordPress Admin, or by using the handcrafted/ directory (containing the theme's files), and 
  uploading via FTP.


  --------------------
  * Using the ZIP file
  --------------------

  The theme comes already packaged in a ZIP archive called handcrafted.zip. You can use this archive 
  to install the theme on your WordPress site. To install your theme, do the following:

  1) Go to Appearance > Themes
  2) Click on the Install Themes Tab, next to "Manage Themes"
  3) Click on Upload
  4) Click on Browse and look for the handcrafted.zip file.
  5) Click on Install Now.

  This procedure will install the Hand Crafted theme on your WordPress site. You can activate the 
  theme after it has been uploaded.

 
  ----------------------------------
  * Using the handcrafted/ directory
  ----------------------------------

  The theme's files are located inside the handcrafted/ directory. To manually install into your 
  server via FTP, do the following:

  1) Login to your WordPress site with your preferred FTP client
  2) Navigate to the /wp-content/themes/ directory
  3) Upload the handcrafted/ directory inside the /wp-content/themes/ directory
  4) After the upload is complete, you will be able to choose the Hand Crafted theme from 
  Appearance > Themes. You can then proceed to activate the theme and start using it.


  ----------------------------------
  * Troubleshooting: Corrupted theme
  ----------------------------------
  
  Sometimes, problems can arise when uploading/installing, and the theme can become corrupted, 
  due to an incomplete installation. WordPress usually reports the broken theme and it says that 
  the Stylesheet (style.css) is missing.

  If your theme becomes corrupted for any reason, do the following to fix it:

  1) Login to your WordPress site with your preferred FTP client
  2) Navigate to the /wp-content/themes/ directory
  3) Remove the handcrafted/ directory completely
  4) After you have removed the handcrafted/ directory, you can proceed to re-install the theme, 
  either by using the ZIP File method, or by using the handcrafted/ directory method.
